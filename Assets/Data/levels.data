// this file is for level data. Format data as follows for each level without any {}'s starting on line 10
// {levelName}:{length},{startPosX},{startPosY},{endHeight}
// where {length} is the number of "blocks" from the left most block to the right most
// startPosX is the x position the player should spawn at
// startPosY is the y position the player should spawn at
// endHeight is the height of the ground where the level ends
// EXAMPLE: Level1:124,5,0,0
// This means that level 1 has a length of 124, the player should start at (5,0) and the level ends at a height of 0
// REAL DATA:
level1:100,-42,-4,0
